# oas_training

This repo will:
1) Download sequences from the observed antibody space (OAS)[https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/oas/]
2) Train a transformer on the data to predict position-specific likelihoods
3) Use trained transformer to humanize masked antibody sequences
4) Measure antibody humanness using an alternative method
